The homepage welcomes guests with a striking hero section highlighting the hotel’s premium offerings — 24/7 concierge, luxury spa, and fine dining experiences — along with a call-to-action button encouraging visitors to book a room.
The Rooms page presents a selection of accommodations, ranging from Deluxe Rooms to Executive Suites and the Presidential Suite, each described with key features to help guests choose their stay.

The About page provides background information on the hotel’s history, values, and mission, emphasizing its dedication to comfort and sophistication.
The Contact page makes it easy for guests to reach the hotel, with address details, a phone number, an email address, and optional integration for maps.
Additionally, the website includes a booking and payment option, where guests can reserve rooms online and pay securely via PayPal (with potential to expand into more payment gateways in the future).
Overall, the M&I Hotel website serves as both a digital brochure and an interactive booking platform, ensuring that visitors can easily learn about the hotel, explore its offerings, and make reservations in a smooth, professional manner.
